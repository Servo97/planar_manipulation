## Dense Planar Object Manipulation Using Switched Linear Control

We currently use PyBullet as a simulator to test control algorithms for a planar pushing task. The task is analogous to pushing chopped vegetables on a chopping board towards a goal using a knife as an end effector. 

To run the simulation just run:

```
python simulate_task.py
```
